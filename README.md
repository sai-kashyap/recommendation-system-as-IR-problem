RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM AS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL USING WORD2VEC AND FAISS:  
Developed a recommendation system by treating user information as documents, converting them into 
vectors using Word2Vec, and applying approximate nearest neighbors' algorithms to find and 
recommend similar users. Developed a new approach to recommend users by leveraging vector 
representations and approximate nearest neighbors
